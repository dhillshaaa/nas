            My girl,

Today is Valentine’s Day… and honestly, it feels a little heavy not being there with you. I know you might be feeling my absence more today, and I wish I could just sit next to you even for a simple cup of tea.

But this distance won’t last long.

I’ll be coming soon… not just to see you, but to marry you and take you with me into our life together.

Don’t worry or feel lonely. Everything I’m doing here is for us — for our future, for the life we are going to build together.

In this whole world, you are the most important person to me. Truly… nothing means more to me than you.

Even though I’m not there beside you today, my heart is always with you.

Wait for me a little more… I’m coming soon.

Love you so much ❤️

Yours Bilal<br><br>
            I am so lucky to call you mine.  
            Forever and always 💗
